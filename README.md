# mystery-box
A random generator for food mystery boxes to challange yourself in the kitchen. With a variation of settings to create the mystery box that best suits you, this will hopefully be a fun tool to use before you go grocery shopping! :)

The layout is planed as follows:

  Name of ingridient. (for meat specified to the piece such as chuck, prime rib, etc..)                 Text
  Type/kind of animal/Vegateble? (for example cow, pig, seafood, vegetables, etc..)                     Text
  A main ingridient? (for example meats and fish but also celeriac, etc.)                               Boolean
  A secondary ingridient? (for example leek, romain, etc...)                                            Boolean
  A base ingridient? (for example cream, butter, spices)                                                Boolean
